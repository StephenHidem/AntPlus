				Welcome to the Small Earth Technology ANT+ class library and examples. My goal is to provide a frictionless
				as possible implementation to enable applications to interface and acquire data from a variety of ANT+
				sensor sources. The primary class is AntPlus and it contains device profiles of ANT+ devices and common data pages.
				The AntRadioInterface class permits different interfaces to the hardware being used and lends itself to
				dependency injection.

			<title>Overview</title>
			<content>
				<para>
					The libraries are largely intended to support applications interfacing to ANT devices.
					This could be a group app, mobile app, push data to the cloud, or some other purpose.
				</para>
				<para>
					The primary projects are AntPlus and AntRadioInterface. AntPlus defines the device profiles
					derived from the AntDevice class. The AntRadioInterface defines an interface to interact
					with an ANT radio to send and receive from an ANT device.

						<para>
							The AntUsbStick class library is derived from AntRadioInterface and implements a concrete
							implementation that supports commercially available ANT USB sticks from Dynastream/Garmin.

						<para>
							The AntMulticastServer console application uses the AntUsbStick class library to send/receive ANT messages over the UDP network protocol.
							A seperate Xamarin Forms solution with an Android app uses this UDP socket. The Xamarin solution is
