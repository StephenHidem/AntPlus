# Version 4.0.0
## Release Date: April 26, 2025
- Added Open Source Maintenance Fee license.
- When the PC goes to sleep or hibernates, the ANT USB stick drivers are closed.
This causes the ANT USB stick service to stop working. The AntUsbStick service will now
handle these events and re-initialize when the PC wakes up.
