# Version 5.0.0
## Release Date: February 12, 2025
### Breaking Changes
- The AntDeviceCollection constructor no longer initiates ANT device scanning. Call the new method StartScanning
after instantiating the AntDeviceCollection.
### New Features
- StartScanning method: this method initializes the ANT radio for continuous scan mode. This is an
asynchronous, awaitable task.
- A new internal class for sending messages to ANT devices - SendMessageChannel. It is a
thread-safe class that uses all available channels to send messages. It is used by the AntDevice
class to send messages to ANT devices. Throughput is much improved when sending messages to multiple
ANT devices simultaneously.
