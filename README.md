# ANT+ Class Library
Welcome to the ANT+ class library and examples. My
goal is to provide a frictionless as possible implementation
to enable applications to interface and
acquire data from a variety of ANT+ sensor sources.
The primary class is AntPlus and it  contains device
profiles of ANT+ devices. AntRadioInterface permits different interfaces to the
hardware being used and lends itself to dependency
injection.
