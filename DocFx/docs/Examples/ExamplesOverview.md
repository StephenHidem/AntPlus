# Examples Overview
This section provides code examples for using the AntRadioInterface and AntPlus class libraries.
The examples demonstrate how to set up an ANT radio, connect to ANT+ devices, and retrieve data
from those devices.
## AntUsbStick Class Library
The AntUsbStick class library provides a simple interface for interacting with ANT USB sticks.
## ANT USB Stick WPF Application
The WpfUsbStickApp is a WPF application that demonstrates how to use the AntUsbStick class library
to connect to ANT+ devices and retrieve data.
## ANT gRPC Service
The ANT gRPC Service example demonstrates how to set up a gRPC service using the AntRadioInterface
and AntPlus class libraries. The service allows clients to connect to ANT+ devices and retrieve data
such as heart rate, speed, and cadence.
## ANT gRPC Shared Library
The ANT gRPC Shared Library example demonstrates how to create a shared library for a gRPC service
that interacts with ANT+ devices using the AntRadioInterface and AntPlus class libraries. The shared
library contains common code that can be used by multiple gRPC services to connect to ANT+ devices
and retrieve data such as heart rate, speed, and cadence.
## MAUI ANT gRPC Client Application
The MAUI ANT gRPC Client example demonstrates how to create a MAUI application that acts as a gRPC
client to connect to an ANT gRPC service. The application retrieves data from ANT+ devices
such as heart rate, speed, and cadence using the AntRadioInterface and AntPlus class libraries.
## ANT gRPC Service Package
The ANT gRPC Service Package example demonstrates how to create a gRPC service that interacts
with ANT+ devices using the AntRadioInterface and AntPlus class libraries. The service allows
clients to connect to ANT+ devices and retrieve data such as heart rate, speed, and cadence.
