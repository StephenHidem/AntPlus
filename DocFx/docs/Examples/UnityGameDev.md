#  Unity Game Development Example
I've created a Unity example project to demonstrate integrating elements of the ANT+ class library and extensions.
The repository is located at [Unity ANT gRPC](https://github.com/StephenHidem/Unity-ANT-gRPC).
The README contains important information!

A warm shout out to the good folks who created NuGetForUnity and YetAnotherHttpHandler! Their efforts are deeply appreciated.
