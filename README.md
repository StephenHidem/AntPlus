# Small Earth Technology ANT+ Class Library
Welcome to the Small Earth Technology ANT+ class library and examples. My goal is to provide a frictionless
as possible implementation to enable applications to interface and acquire data from a variety of ANT+
sensor sources. The primary class is AntPlus and it contains device profiles of ANT+ devices and common data pages.
The AntRadioInterface class permits different interfaces to the hardware being used and lends itself to
dependency injection.

The class library is a .NET standard 2.0 compliant assembly in order to provide the broadest application reach,
from desktop applications to mobile platforms.
## Prerequisites
Become an ANT+ Adopter! There is no membership fee. 
Create a login and go to https://www.thisisant.com/my-ant/join-adopter. This provides you with access to
device profiles, SDK's, and useful software tools.
- Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition.
- OPTIONAL: ANT USB stick hardware and device drivers. I use two sticks for testing and some projects require it.
You can get them from DigiKey for around $45 for two.
- OPTIONAL: Only needed if you intend to modify the libraries generated. Download the ANT PC SDK zip file https://www.thisisant.com/resources/ant-windows-library-package-with-source-code/, unblock, and install.
